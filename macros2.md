## Customer Service Macros

**What are macros?** 

A macro is a pre-written response for customer-facing use, commonly used in help desk software services such as Zendesk or Salesforce. Macros save time, increase productivity, ensure accuracy, and reduce error. 

I create and maintain a repository of over 200 macros for a customer support team. 

### 2. Black Friday 

**Scenario:** In November 2019, the marketing department ran a Black Friday/Cyber Monday promotion. This promotion included a discounted subscription price for new customers. Existing subscription customers were not eligible for this lower rate.

The Customer Care team was challenged with responding to pushback from angry existing customers, while maintaining company line on marketing campaign decisions. 

*Macro Copy:
> Thank you for following up on this and for your honest feedback!
>
>I understand you're disappointed to not receive the new customer promotional discount, and I've certainly passed this along to our team here.
>
>It's never our intention to do wrong by our users. We try to honor this by extending our loyal customers bonus content when we run these sort of promotions or summits.
>
>It's true that we run several marketing campaigns every year, and these each come with different offer levels for new and existing customers. While new users who join during this promotion receive a different discount offer, customers who have joined us in the past have received thousands of dollars worth of bonus content that are not available during this offer.
>
>All this being said, we value you and your input. We're always here to try and help you be successful. Your sincere and  honest feedback is appreciated, as we always consider customer feedback when crafting future campaigns.
>
>If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out at any time. We're happy to help, and hope you have a great day!
