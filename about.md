Steve is passionate about all of his pursuits. To have fun with Kubernetes, 
he built a cluster out of Raspberry Pi 4s. Steve ran seven full marathons, did two 100-mile bike rides, 
completed one sprint triathlon, and climbed Long’s Peak in Colorado. When he isn’t building or learning 
about cloud-native micro-services, you will find Steve learning Spanish. He traded his annual destination 
marathon trip with a week of Spanish immersion school somewhere in Latin America each year.
