## A guide on Mathematical Proofs

**Project description:** Quick tips on how to make the most out of your time in your first trial of proving things. If you have any suggestions, please send me an email.

#### 1. Have a handy collection of definitions and (maybe) the most important theorems. When facing a question that you don’t know how to start, start simply by stating the definitions and theorems.
#### 2. Divide by cases! It works a lot!
#### 3. Use proof by contradiction. It is really easy to use! (But some people don’t like it since it does not shed light on any specific thing about knowing the stuff)
#### 4. Do not be hasty. The ability to prove things is nurtured proportional to the effort you put into it and it may come over time.
#### 5. You can use (and abuse) of symbols such as **∀,∃… but on the other hand, it is nice to translate it back to words, or vice-versa.**
