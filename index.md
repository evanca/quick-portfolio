I also created customer profiles based on features such as brand loyalty, demographic info, order frequency, family status, regions, and other. On the basis of the analysis results, I gave recommendations to the marketing and sales departments regarding the upcoming marketing campaign to improve customer loyalty and boost sales. </p>
