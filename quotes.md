It's like if you want to be a good pianist,
you have to do a lot of scales and a lot of practice,
and a lot of that is kind of boring, it's work.
But you need to do that before you can really be very expressive and really play beautiful music.
You have to go through that phase of practice and drill.
- Terry Tao

― Amos Tversky, Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases

“When you are a pessimist and the bad thing happens, you live it twice. Once when you worry about it, and the second time when it happens.” 
― Amos Tversky

“Show me the axiom and I’ll design the experiment that refutes it”
